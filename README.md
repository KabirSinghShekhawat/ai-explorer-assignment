# StackIt Hiring Assignment (AI Engineering Explorer)

### Welcome to StackIt's hiring assignment! üöÄ

**If you didn't get here through github classroom, are you sure you're supposed to be here? ü§®**


We are glad to have you here, but before you read what you're going to beat your head over for the next few hours (maybe days?), let's get a few things straight:
- We really appreciate honesty. Don't copy anyone else's assignment, it'll only sabotage your chances
- You're free to use any stack, and library of your choice. Use whatever you can get your hands on, on the internet!
- We love out of the box solutions. We prefer to call it *Jugaad* 
- This might be just the first round, but carries the most importance of all. Give your best, and we hope you have a fun time solving this problem.

## ‚ú® **Problem Statement: Crafting a LIVE Report Builder for Google Sheets** ‚ú®

**Context**:
For any software company to integrate a 3rd party APIs (eg. Stripe APIs, Shopify APIs) they need to write custom code which often takes days/months to integrate across 20-30 CRUD use cases. It requires businesses to setup entire engineering teams, build data pipelines, hiring product & project teams and what not.

**Today, YOU are going to make lives better for Engineering teams**

**Problem Statement**:
Your job is to develop an intelligent software integrator that ONLY supports read operations in the Software 2.0 world. Your tool can accept training information / documents and partially written code as well to amplify the code generation. 

**Expectation**:
Do not try to perfect it, it‚Äôs a long journey. Build a proof of concept with some degree of accuracy.

**Typical Input**:
Context and training data to correctly understand the 3rd Party SaaS and to correctly understand the supported api documentations and everything. 

**Typical Output**:
An API agent / Microservice that can authenticate and fetch data from the 3rd party api source.

**Other pointers**:
1. Put the right checks and balances in your system. Do not custom code this out.
2. Brownie points if you can define proper benchmarks for such a tool's existence.
  
## Submission ‚è∞
The timeline for this submission is: **Next 4 days**

Some things you might want to take care of:
- Make use of git and commit your steps!
- Use good coding practices.
- Write beautiful and readable code. Well-written code is nothing less than a work of art.
- Use semantic variable naming.
- Your code should be organized well in files and folders which is easy to figure out.
- If there is something happening in your code that is not very intuitive, add some comments.
- Add to this README at the bottom explaining your approach (brownie points üòã)

Once you're done, make sure you **record a video** showing your project working. The video should **NOT** be longer than 120 seconds. While you record the video, tell us about your biggest blocker, and how you overcame it! Don't be shy, talk us through, we'd love that.

We have a checklist at the bottom of this README file, which you should update as your progress with your assignment. It will help us evaluate your project.

- [ ] My code is somewhat working! ü•≥
- [ ] I have recorded a video showing it working and embedded it in the README ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- [ ] I have tested all the normal working cases üòé
- [ ] I have even solved some edge cases (brownie points) üí™
- [ ] I added my very planned-out approach to the problem at the end of this README üìú
